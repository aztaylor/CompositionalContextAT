\begin{abstract}
  This is an attempt to port Enoch Yeung's Compositional Context Scripts to Julia while 
  expanding them to include the option of adding addition genes, the effect on energetic 
  regions, and to study the effect targeted DNA binding (i.e. Cas effectors) proteins
  have on the results they observed. This is mainly a notebook so that I can keep track of
  the math.
