# Recreation and modification of models used in the paper "Biophysical Constrainsts Arising from the Compositional Context of Synthetic Gene Networks".
## Alec Taylor, Bahareh Dehghan Banadaki, Enoch Yeung.
This code arose from a final project for which we attempeted to recreate and modify the models of cell free expression of convergent genes in a synthetic network.
Our aim was to modify the code to include the effect of DNA binding protein. It's Still a work in progress.
